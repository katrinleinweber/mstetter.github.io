{"name":"Markus Stetter","tagline":"","body":"# Welcome to my page\r\n\r\nI am a Phd student, programmer and amaranth breeder. Here I would like to give you some insights into my different projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Science\r\n\r\nScience is my first passion. I am a PhD student in the group Karl Schmid at the University of Hohenheim. There I study the domestication history of amaranth and try to elucidate the species relationship in the _Amaranthus_ genus\r\n\r\n## Programming\r\n\r\nPhenoType is my first large programming project. \r\nPhenoTpye is a digital field book allowing you to easily record data of experiments. It runs on Android devices and is therefore very flexible. To test PhenoType  for free you can download PhenoType lite [PhenoType lite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phenotype_lite.phenotype_lite)\r\nPhenoType is efficient and easy to use. Just try [PhenoType](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phenotype.phenotype)\r\nAnother app from the PhenoType family is PhenoType Camera which is a camera app that allows you to name the image files the way you want. This makes it easier to keep track of you images.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about the PhenoType projects visit [PhenoType-online.com](https://www.PhenoType-online.com)\r\n\r\n## Amaranth breeding and domestication\r\n\r\nIn my free time I grow and breed amaranth with the long term (50 years or so) goal to domesticate amaranth. \r\n\r\n![Amaranth flowers](https://github.com/mstetter/mstetter.github.io/blob/master/own_images/DSC_0020.jpg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
