My main interest is the population genetics of crop domestication

From February 2017 I will be a PostDoc in the [Ross-Ibarra lab](http://www.rilab.org/) at the University of California Davis.

I did my PhD in the group of [Karl Schmid](http://evoplant.uni-hohenheim.de) at the University of Hohenheim. There I studied the evolution of the genus *Amaranthus* and domestication history of amaranth.
